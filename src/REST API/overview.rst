.. warning::

  REST API described here is work in progress. It changes
  along with the development of `Papermerge Core <https://github.com/papermerge/papermerge-core>`_ in master branch.

In order to use REST API interface you need an http client. Probably the most
wide-spread (and free) http client is `cUrl <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CURL>`_.

Another convenient, free to use and with graphical user interface http client is
`Postman <https://www.postman.com/>`_.

In following sections cUrl will be used to illustrate examples of usages.
